Not gonna lie had a lot of work, even with background image few hours :D
I don't know well how resizing or flexbox 100% works, because for example, when I add border to for example input element when hover then my whole content moves, tried googling it, but didn't learnt how to fix that well, I fixed it by reducing margin, I know it is bad, but at least it is working :D I hope in the future to learn how to fix that, or maybe just use grid or something better :)
